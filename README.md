This library provides functionality to get the Julian Dates and Universal Time values from a Unix Timestamp. It also provides functions to get the current Julian Date and Universal Time.

The easiest way to use the library is probably to just copy the code in [julian_now.cljc](./src/julian_now.cljc). Its presence on any library repository is primarily as an exercise in setting up a publish pipeline.
